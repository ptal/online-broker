Online broker
=====================================

Game where the user can buy and sell currencies to make money.

Project's Structure
=====================================

The project is splitted into three subprojects. One
that contains the website, another that contains a daemon
that updates the db when the currencies' exchange rates
change and another with code shared by the website and
the daemon

Update the database
=====================================

- To init the database the user needs to execute the class
fr.jussieu.InitDB in the daemon.

- To update the currencies the user needs to execute the class
fr.jussieu.Daemon in the daemon.


Database Connection parameters
======================================

The parameters to connect to the db should be stored in ~/.aar-sqlcredentials.
They cannot be stored in the github repo because they change between the
dev and prod environments and for obvious security reasons.

How to package the daemon and the web
======================================

To deploy the webapp from the onlineBroker project use the command dist that generates
a zip file.

To deploy the daemon from the daemon project use the command assembly

TODO
======================================

-When the daemon finishes it should call /api/db/updated/ and when the html table
is updated in the currencies page it should be updated with a transition (e.g jquery ui)
-Add total amount in dollars in My Accounts page

Running webapp
=======================================

The webapp runs in a tmux terminal. To restart it or see the logs live, we need
to run "tmux attach" from the amazon instance.

Notes
=======================================

-Since the application uses securesocial to login users through their github accounts
the development environment needs modifications for oauth to work in the developement
environment. While developing the app the user needs to add the following to its
/etc/hosts file to be able to login:

127.0.0.1   ec2-54-194-70-170.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com

This needs to be removed to be able to test the application on prod again.


Dependencies
=====================================
- Play 2.2.1
- Slick
