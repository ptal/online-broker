Online broker
=====================================

Game where the user can buy and sell currencies to make money.

Project's Structure
=====================================

The project is splitted into three subprojects. One
that contains the website, another that contains a daemon
that updates the db when the currencies' exchange rates
change and another with code shared by the website and
the daemon

Update the database
=====================================

- To init the database the user needs to execute the class
fr.jussieu.InitDB in the daemon.

- To update the currencies the user needs to execute the class
fr.jussieu.Daemon in the daemon.


Database Connection parameters
======================================

The parameters to connect to the db should be stored in ~/.aar-sqlcredentials.
They cannot be stored in the github repo because they change between the
dev and prod environments and for obvious security reasons.

How to package the daemon and the web
======================================

To deploy the webapp from the onlineBroker project use the command dist that generates
a zip file.

To deploy the daemon from the daemon project use the command assembly

TODO
======================================

When the daemon finishes it should call /api/db/updated/ and when the html table
is updated in the currencies page it should be updated with a transition (e.g jquery ui)

Running webapp
=======================================

The webapp runs in a tmux terminal. To restart it or see the logs live, we need
to run "tmux attach" from the amazon instance.


Dependencies
=====================================
- Play 2.2.1
- Slick
